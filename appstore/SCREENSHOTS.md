# AlphaTyper — Screenshot Checklist

Take screenshots **in the iOS Simulator** (best quality) once TestFlight/App Store Connect is ready.

## Screens to capture (recommended)
- Practice (tabs visible + main practice area)
- Analytics & Coach (analytics section visible)
- Run History (table visible)
- Account (showing Login & Cloud Sync and/or Signed in status)

## Device sizes to plan for
Apple may require screenshots for specific display sizes depending on your supported devices.

Recommended targets:
- iPhone 6.7" (e.g., iPhone 15 Pro Max)
- iPhone 6.1" (e.g., iPhone 15 Pro)

If you ship iPad:
- iPad 12.9" (or 13")

## Simulator tips
- Use Light Mode screenshots unless you plan to include both.
- Hide the keyboard unless you specifically want to show typing.
- Make sure the app is not clipped (safe-area) and tabs are readable.

## Where to save
Create a local folder:
- `appstore/screenshots/`

Name files like:
- `iphone-6.1-practice.png`
- `iphone-6.1-analytics.png`
- `iphone-6.1-history.png`
- `iphone-6.1-account.png`
