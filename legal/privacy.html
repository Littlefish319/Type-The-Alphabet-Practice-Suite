      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="muted">Last updated: December 27, 2025</p>

      <p>
        Alphabet Typing Suite (the “App”) is provided by YuNova LLC (“we”, “us”). This Privacy Policy explains what data the App
        collects and how it is used.
      </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The App stores your practice data <strong>locally on your device</strong> (for example, run history and settings).</li>
        <li>We do not sell personal data.</li>
        <li>If you use the optional AI Coach feature, your message text is sent to an AI provider to generate a response.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data the App stores on your device</h2>
      <p>
        The App stores practice data locally on your device, such as timing logs, run history, selected profile/device names, and
        settings. This data is saved in on-device storage and is not automatically sent to us.
      </p>

      <h2>AI Coach</h2>
      <p>
        If you choose to use the AI Coach feature, the text you type into the coach input is transmitted to an AI provider to
        generate a response. Do not include sensitive information in your messages.
      </p>

      <h2>Diagnostics</h2>
      <p>
        We do not intentionally collect diagnostics or analytics in the App. If your operating system or platform provides crash
        reports to you or to Apple, those reports are handled by the platform under its own policies.
      </p>

      <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
      <p>
        The App is not designed to collect personal information from children. If you believe personal information was submitted
        through the App, contact us and we will work to address it.
      </p>

      <h2>Your choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You can delete local app data by deleting the App from your device.</li>
        <li>You can avoid using AI Coach by not sending messages in that feature.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <p>
        If you have questions about this policy, contact: <a href="mailto:contact@yunova.org">contact@yunova.org</a>
